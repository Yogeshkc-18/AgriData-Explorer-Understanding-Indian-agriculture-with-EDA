# AgriData-Explorer-Understanding-Indian-agriculture-with-EDA

Indian Agricultural Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural crop production data across Indian states and districts using Power BI, Python, and SQL. The aim is to help farmers, policymakers, and researchers gain insights into production trends, yield, and cultivation patterns.

Dataset
File: filtered_agriculture_data.csv

Includes columns:

Year, State Name, District Name

Area, Production, and Yield for various crops: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Oilseeds, Cotton, etc.

Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python

Visualize production trends and crop comparisons using Power BI

Execute SQL queries for deep crop-wise insights

Identify top-performing states and districts by crop and year

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for data cleaning, EDA, heatmaps, plots

PostgreSQL / SQL – for production queries and correlation analysis

Power BI – for creating interactive dashboards

GitHub – for version control and documentation

EDA Visualizations
Bar charts (top states/districts)

Line charts (yearly trends)

Heatmaps (correlation between area and production)

Scatter plots (Area vs Production)

Pie charts (state production share)

Correlation analysis (Rice, Wheat, Maize)
